JEPA - Video Classification using Masked Latent Prediction
This repository contains an implementation of the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) applied to video classification tasks. JEPA is a masked prediction model that learns spatiotemporal representations by predicting the latent representations of masked video patches.

📌 Features
Upload and classify short videos using a pretrained JEPA model

Uses Gradio interface for interactive video uploads

Built-in webcam support (optional)

Lightweight and runs on Colab or local GPU

🧠 Model Architecture
JEPA leverages self-supervised learning by masking portions of the input and training a transformer-based encoder to predict the latent features of the masked regions. This approach allows the model to learn general representations of video dynamics without requiring explicit frame-level annotations.

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jepa-video-classification.git
cd jepa-video-classification
2. Install Dependencies
Use the following command to install required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you’re using Google Colab, the required libraries should install automatically in the notebook.

3. Run the Notebook
Open Jepa.ipynb in Jupyter or Colab:

Open in Google Colab

Follow the cells to run the interface.

4. Run Locally with Gradio (optional)
To run the interface locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
🧪 Example Use

The model will output the predicted action or category
